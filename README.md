# SpamFIltering
Spam filtering by categorising the keywords and then applying NaiveBayes Classification

Before applying NaiveBayes, Spam and ham Keywords are obtained from the existing files in the spam and ham folders.
Once the keywords are set the thread is trained based on the existing dataset and keywords.
New messgaes are obtained for every 5 seconds and NaiveBayes classification is applied on it to find if it is a spam or ham message.
