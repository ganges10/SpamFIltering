Subject: A New Year's Dream
Dear 

In December 1992 my brother left South Africa to build a future in the U.S.A. 
He managed to find a job, married an American girl, built himself a house, he fulfilled the great American dream! 
Meanwhile South Africa got a new government that started to plunder what 
was once a great country. What was not plundered by government, was taken by
gangsters.
My brother urged me to come to America as all hope for a decent and safe future 
in South Africa faded over the horizon. It was easier said than done because the 
local currency lost value against the dollar at the speed of sound and the price of 
going to the States became astronomical.
In February 1998 my brother phoned me to tell me that he has secured a job for me
and a work permit. (Green card) I sold my little business and all our furniture
to purchase a plane ticket to the U.S.A.
