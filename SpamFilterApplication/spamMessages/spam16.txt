In February 1998 my brother phoned me to tell me that he has secured a job for me
and a work permit. (Green card) I sold my little business and all our furniture
to purchase a plane ticket to the U.S.A.
When I got there, I found out that he has lied to me in order to get me to the States
so that he could show off his new car and house and other "toys."
I could not secure a job because I did not have the necessary work permit.
Sadly I had to return to South Africa with no more money left. A friend lent us his old
trailer to live in and we are battling to make a living.
We have two teenage children and our wish is for them to be able to go to America and get a decent upbringing. As things stand now, there is no hope that we can
get our kids out of this hell-hole that they call South Africa without outside help.
We would like to appeal for any help you are able to give or any small donation 
(even if it is only $5) so that we can secure the future of our precious children.
Please deposit your donation in MASTER CARD account number 541193163339015

Your help is greatly appreciated.
God Bless!!
